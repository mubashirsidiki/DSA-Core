# DSA Core

Welcome to DSA Core, your go-to resource for fundamental data structures and algorithms!

## Overview

DSA Core is a repository aimed at providing a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. Here, you'll find implementations of basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with essential algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversing these structures.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Includes classes and methods for various fundamental data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Contains implementations of basic algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
- **Usage**: Explore each data structure and algorithm to understand its implementation and usage.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/mubashirsidiki/DSA-Core.git)
```

Then, explore the directories for data structures and algorithms that interest you. Each directory contains detailed documentation and examples to help you understand and use the implementations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug, have an enhancement suggestion, or want to add a new data structure or algorithm, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
